            <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Dolores Mortem.</p> 
            <p>𝐝𝐨𝐛. January 2nd, 203 A.D.</p>  
            <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Cursed witch.</p>  
            <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Fluid.</p>  
            <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. She/They.</p>  
            
            <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Therapist.</p>  
            
            <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Available (multi-ship).</p>  
            
            <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p> 
            <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. While centuries of sheer agony have turned her heart cold, she once was a naive and innocent soul. Upon their return, Dolores shut herself down to all, refusing to let herself be played again : instead, she does as she desires, as she needs in order to survive and lessen their own anguish. A part of them desperately aches for connection again, but their mind refuses to indulge it. She is out for herself, as she deems they should be in order to get their revenge.</p>  
            <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Anya Chalotra.</p> 
            
            <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>  
            <p>　　 On the night of the first and second of January 203 A.D. were born twins. Mina and Dolores Mortem, the former was born in the evening of January 1st and the second, in the dawn of January 2nd. Their mother gave her last breath to bring her second daughter into the world, and their people deemed it an omen. Those who didn't, eventually did when the news arrived that they had lost the war that'd been raging since around the time of her conception. In order to save their kingdom, or such was the reason given to their people, the seneschal took the decision to take the second child away. The cursed one, they called her.</p>  
            <p>　　 Near their home could be found a forest that was deemed just as cursed as she was, and the seneschal deemed it fitting enough. In a sense, he had been correct : though not in the way he had expected. Unable to murder an infant, he had left her there to die. Instead, she was found by the forbidden folk : creatures with magic said too dark to be allowed in the kingdoms. Perhaps were they children like her, abandoned and found by darker creatures, no one really knew. What Dolores knew, however, was that they had rescued and taken care of her.</p>  
            <p>　　 The forbidden folk became but family members, and the people who had forsaken her but odd creatures they knew nothing of. Dolores didn't know she was the princess of the kingdom that haunted her kind, only that she feared them.</p>  
            <p>　　 On a day when her curiosity got the better of her, however, Dolores met a familiar face : her own, though her mirror image was bright and joyful, while she was the very opposite. Their physical similarity wasn't the only thing she found to be familiar, as she soon realized the mark on her neck was one she shared with the stranger. Spooked, she ran back inside the forest. Only, it was already too late. Mina had questions, which she promptly brought to her seneschal, whom she knew to be her protector and caretaker. Soon enough, the forest was raided without Mina's knowledge, having comforted her with a satisfying lie. Many were killed, and she was captured and thrown into a cell.</p>  
            <p>　　 For weeks, she was barely kept alive. Eventually, they were introduced to a woman she recognized as a mage. Dolores thought to see the end of her misery, but it was only the beginning as the witch trapped them into a box known to contain all the sins and anguish of the world : the pandora box.</p> 
            <p>　　 Dolores was trapped for centuries, until someone opened the box and she held onto the familiar darkness to slip out along with it.</p>  
            <p>　　 Once out of the box, in 2019, Dolores began trying to live again. Though the lingering darkness that raged of her, she realized, was one not to easily tamed. In order to keep in check, she requires misery : hence her choice of major, psychology. A dose of ambition, determination and a trickle of magic got her a secure position as a therapist. Despite her claim, Dolores doesn't care to help these people : she cares to feed off their misery for her own personal gain.</p>
