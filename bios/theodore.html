            <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Theodore Sinclair.</p>
            <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-five years old.</p>
            <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Arcane Warlock.</p>
            <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Closeted bisexual.</p>
            <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. He/Him.</p>

            <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Auto mechanic.</p>

            <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Available.</p>

            <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p>
            <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Theo has a tendency to be quite literally : a dick. Raised and taught by a sexist and brutal man, he learned to behave and think as his uncle did. Deep down, he knows his behavior is wrong, but he cannot help himself as his uncle's approval is the only one he feels matters. And honestly, the only person who ever even bothered to give him enough attention. He has a lot of internalized homophobia because of what his uncle taught him was right, and refuses to indulge the part of him that finds interest in other men.</p>
            <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Aron Piper.</p>

            <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>
            <p>　　 Just like his cousin Beau, Theodore was raised in a rather toxic environment where men ruled and women were viewed as nothing more than mere tools. Albeit initially a lighthearted boy, Theo soon turned into what his family expected him to become. While his own parents were different, they were absent. His mother died when he was younger of an overdose, and his father worked all the time.</p>
            <p>　　 The truth is, the reason why he got closer to his uncle to begin with was because his own father was mostly absent from his life, constantly delaying responsibilities to his son. He didn't mean any harm, and thought Theo old enough to be able to handle it all perfectly. Alas, he was mistaken : he was just a young boy, and all of this burden brought him to act out. And ultimately, he got his uncle's attention, who taught him to be what he called a 'successful' man. Meaning, a violent and intolerant man.</p>
            <p>　　 He went about his life with a sense of entitlement and superiority that got worse whenever his uncle was around, as he wanted to make him proud : to show him that he, too, could be a /real/ man. One night, however, Alexander (his uncle and Beau's father) spotted him outside a club, completely drunk and making out with another man. All Theodore remembered then, was that he woke up at the hospital, having lost sight in one eye because of the violence of his uncle's punches. He then visited him, reassuring him that he would 'fix' his deviant ways. To do so, he hired prostitute after prostitute and forced him to engage in the same amount of violence he had whenever encountering a man Alexander deemed 'unworthy'.</p>
            <p>　　 After a while, it became a second nature to him and he would act as taught unprovoked, and without Alexander's presence. He abandoned his dreams of being a model, as this too was deemed to be a 'girl's thing' and became a mechanic instead, like his uncle.</p>
            <p>　　 When the latter died, Theodore moved to the US to find his cousin and fix him as his uncle had him.</p>

            <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
