                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Beau Sinclair.</p> 
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-nine years old.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Mental warlock.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Pansexual.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. He/They.</p>

                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Former soldier / Personal trainer and occasional teacher at The Divine Trinity.</p> 

                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Unavailable ( single-ship ).</p> 

                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic good : those that combine a good heart with a free spirit.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Beau has a rather explosive temper : though he knows to use it well enough that it doesn't harm others, but himself. He is self-destructive, which tends to get him into a lot of dangerous situations, but it doesn't matter to him : hardly anything ever does considering the amount of self-loathing he has. Aside from that, Beau has a tendency to be provocative, but he can also be kind and humorous. He never means to harm anyone else but himself, but his destructive tendencies tend to do that for him anyway.</p> 
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Jaime Lorente / Jeremy Allen White.</p> 

                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p> 
                <p>　　 Beau was raised in a family ruled by men, and at the top of it all, his father. He reigned in terror, teaching his sons and nephews to be just as vile as he was, to treat women like properties and to harness all of that anger : to thrive in it. As much as anyone could. This led Beau to have pretty damaging anger issues, added to his growing powers enabling him to hear every single thought from miles away. The constant noise became his greatest enemy : and because of it, one day, as his sister was cheerfully teasing him, he exploded. He began choking her, and then his father entered the room : demanding he pursued, demanding he killed her for her insolence. Indeed, their father was no stranger to such violence : he would beat up his sons and nephews when they didn't respect his rules, and the girls? They got a treatment even harsher. His mother paid the price with her life. Something only Beau knew, as he'd been there to witness it. Though all suspected it.</p> 
                <p>　　 When he saw himself become the man he loathed most in the world, Beau ran. He enlisted in the British army and has not returned to his hometown since. He didn't even attend Isabela's funerals, as he was too frightened he would fess up at the sight. Beau had always been a coward, and the death of his confidant, by his own hands, did nothing to change it.</p>
                <p>　　 From that moment, Beau became haunted by her. Something he thought to be her ghost at the time, constantly over his shoulder, reminding him how unworthy of love he was, how terrible he was. He would realize only years later, upon her resurrection, that it'd only ever been a form of his self-loathing developing on another level through his magical abilities. Once again, his powers worked against him.</p> 
                <p>　　 During his time in the army, Beau made the acquaintance of one Damon Roux. The two soon became close friends, and he deemed him his confidant : even more so after finding out his companion shared his burden. Indeed, Damon was a mental warlock as well. That wasn't all that he was, Beau found out as he watched him thrive in the violence the war granted him. But he chose to put that part of him aside, for years after their time in the army, despite discovering his even more somber activities. During an intervention, Beau lost control of his abilities and the mental explosion that occurred then killed a hundred of his companions : all but Damon. He stuck with him afterwards.</p> 
                <p>　　 When reaching New Orleans, Beau found out Damon's girlfriend, alongside a friend of his, were held captive in a coven called The Divine Trinity. Beau went undercover in the coven, and slowly became a part of it altogether. And though he continued trying to help his friend, he began getting attached to people inside : mainly, Violet and Iris Valentine. The former, even falling in love with despite his believed incapacity to ever love anyone. He prevented himself from indulging his feelings for a long, long time until a deal with Damon allowed him to let go of his demons, and admit to himself the truth. The good sides of this contract, however, didn't last as it not only have him let go of his guilt, but of his sense of righteousness as well. He became heartless, as ironic as that was. He killed, cheated and betrayed.</p> 
                <p>　　 After he eventually got himself out of the compulsion his former friend had placed on him, Beau snapped and went straight to the killer's latest known hideout. He found him, attacked him and ultimately murdered him. This kill wasn't one he regretted.</p> 
                <p>　　 Not long after, Beau planned on returning to the army, to stop himself from giving himself the same treatment he had given Damon. That was until Violet told him she was pregnant with his child. From this point, he decided to step up. To prove himself that he was worth a damn : which was further fueled by the unexpected return of his sister Isabela, who didn't loathe him for his past actions as much as he thought she did. Though that guilt lingers, he tries. Wanting to be better, not only for Violet, his upcoming daughters and his sister : but also for himself. At last.</p>

                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. The Divine Trinity.</p>
