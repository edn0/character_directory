                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Richard Valentine.</p>
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Fifty years old / Appears to be thirty-three.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Warlock.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Straight.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. He/Him.</p>
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Former police officer.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Unavailable-ish.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic good : those that combine a good heart with a free spirit.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Richard is a strong-headed man, and very devoted to his family. Although he won’t admit it, he has a hero complex and that’s precisely what led him to leave his wife and daughters to attempt saving them on his own.</p> 
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Karl Urban / Jeffrey Dean Morgan.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p> 
                <p>　　 Richard is the elder brother of two brothers, all scattered around the world. The two men parted ways long before their children were born for a stupid reason neither of them could remember. As it goes, though, they were prideful enough to stick to their former selves' statements and keep the distance.</p> 
                <p>　　 However, when he found out about the curse that linked all Valentine to Hell due to an old deal their ancestor had made with Lucifer to keep their bloodline going, he'd decided to act. Thus, not long after the birth of his youngest daughter, Violet, he decided to leave to find his brother and find a way out of the loop with him. Stronger together, those were the Valentine words after all.</p> 
                <p>　　 Unfortunately, Richard never reached his brother and instead, was found by one of Lucifer's demon. The Devil having realized what he was trying to do, 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 interrupted him before he could find any solution to detatching himself and his family from 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗺. Ever since, he has been stuck in Hell. A breathing, living man emprisoned in a golden cage. Leaving his daughters unaware of their powers, and more importantly, thinking he'd abandoned them.</p> 
                <p>　　 He remained in Hell for nineteen years until his eldest daughter, Iris, joined him. She'd died protecting her sister. As any Valentine would do. Even without his presence, his girls had stuck together. Stronger together, something they had learned on their own. It was then he also learned his wife, highschool sweetheart, had fallen to her demons and turned to alcohol before meeting an untimely death. By his daughter's hand. Despite the heartbreak that'd caused him, both for his lover and for the daughters he hadn't been around to protect from her, he didn't blame Iris. Magic was unpredictabe, impulsive. Especially to a young, unexperienced with. Though he could tell, through the years, she'd grown to become much more powerful than he's ever been.</p> 
                <p>　　 As had Violet. Whom he managed to contact through her abilities to see the dead. This was an ability he'd always known she would grow to develop and thus, for two decades, he'd tried to contact her. Until, eventually, he did. It was the first time he'd felt peace in two decades. Warmth. The kind that didn't hurt. He'd almost forgotten how that felt.</p> 
                <p>　　 A year later, he was brought back among the living. Though he knew, better than anyone, that Lucifer wouldn't simply let it slide.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
