                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Iris Valentine.</p>
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-eight years old.</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Elemental Witch.</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Pansexual.</p>
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Pediatrician.</p>
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. In a relationship with Sam Winchester.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic good : those that combine a good heart with a free spirit.</p>
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Iris has always put others before herself, her family especially. She is devoted to a fault, and would go to great lengths to protect those she loves - as proven when she accidentally killed her mother in an attempt to defend Violet from her drunken rage. She deeply struggles with the concept of letting go, and putting herself first for a change. Indeed, peace isn't a concept she can grasp, thus constantly living in a state of pre-catastrophe.</p>
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Alycia Debnam-Carey / Victoria Pedretti / Emmy Rossum.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>
                <p>　　 When Iris was seven years old, her father Richard decided to go on a quest that was unknown to her at the time, leaving her to care for the rest of the family. What he may have believed to be but a silly thing before saying goodbye, turned out to be her life for the following years. Indeed, when Richard left, her mother fell to drugs and alcohol as a mean to cope with the loss, leaving Iris to care for her three siblings - the youngest whom had just been born a couple of days prior.</p>
                <p>　　 Ever since the night of her father's disappearance, Iris has raised and taken care of her siblings, even if the twins that came after she was born seemed more appreciated by their mother than Iris and Violet were. They would soon learn why : Rose and Lilac weren't Richard's and therefore, Selene deemed them worthy of her attention. Perhaps it was just a mean to get revenge on him, even if the only ones who suffered from it were her daughters.</p> 
                <p>　　 Eventually, when Iris came of age, she decided to quit high-school so she could work a second job and better provide for her siblings. Thus, abandoning her dreams of ever becoming a pediatrician.</p> 
                <p>　　 One day, as she was returning home from work, she found Selene attacking Violet with a broken beer bottle. In an attempt to protect the latter, she stepped in-between and without understanding how, burned her mother to death. Her powers had awoken to protect her little sister. Knowing they couldn't stay here after what she had just done, Iris stole her mother's tickets she'd found days prior in a drawer and aimed to leave Australia with her siblings. Only, Lilac and Rose refused to come along after discovering what Iris had done. Thus, they parted ways and she left for New York with Violet.</p>
                <p>　　 The two stayed on the streets for what felt like months, engaging in illegal traffics and getting close to shady people in order to keep themselves warm and fed. Eventually, she was found by a man who offered to house her. Thanks to him, she managed to find a job and put Violet back to school. And when the time came to leave again, she said her goodbyes and went on their next adventure.</p> 
                <p>　　 Iris and Violet met a lot of people throughout their journey, and eventually settled in New Orleans to a coven of witches and other supernatural creatures.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. The Divine Trinity.</p>
