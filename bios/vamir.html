            <p>NAME.　» Vamir Erfolg.</p>
            <p>ALSO KNOWN AS.　» Vam, The Scientist.</p>
            <p>DATE OF BIRTH.　» 27 february 226 A.D.</p>
            <p>SPECIES.　» Vampyre-witch hybrid.</p>
            <p>METHOD OF IMMORTALITY.　» Consuming.</p>
            
            <p>OCCUPATION.　» Coroner (both human and supernatural factions; on demand).</p>
            <p>ALIGNMENT.　» Neutral evil: those that advance themselves without regard for others.</p>
            <p>PERSONALITY.　» Vamir is a quiet antagonist. He is calculated, able to appear docile and even amicable at times, only to ensnare his victims with a new breed of devastating brutality. He flinches from nothing, affixed in a grimness that typically leaves him, as he prefers it, in solitude.</p>
            
            <p>FACECLAIM / s.　» Bill Skarsgard.</p>
            
            <p>HISTORY.　⤸</p>
            <p>　　»» As the first son, Vamir was held to an expectancy that he never bothered to achieve, either through spite or simple uncaring. Even as a child, the male was doused in morbidities that was bemusing in contrast to the outright boorishness of his family. Effectively abducted by his grandfather when he yet retained his youth, Vamir was - as his father had been, and as his brother would be later - put through a series of tortures and cruel tests to ‘prove his worth’. It was clear that, even as well as he took to the suffering of the training he underwent, he had no inherent inkling of loyalty to his family.</p>
            <p>　　»» Fatherly abuse was something of a tradition in the Erfolg household, and with each passing generation, the effects seem to scald deeper. So internally crushed by the cruelties done to him, Vamir took to self-flogging in secret, punishing himself, as he had been by his father and grandfather, simply for existing.</p>
            <p>　　»» Though peculiar, self-destructive and a little too grim, Vamir showed pieces of kindness in his youth. Innocence even. That all changed after the massacre of the Tharos and he bore witness to the extent of his family's depravity. Something in him shut down, or maybe gave in, to a greater darkness.</p>
            <p>　　»» He took to alchemy and other amateur scientific outlets, fastidiously studying anything he could get his hands on, but his focus very rapidly centred on matters of death. By his adolescence, he killed merely so as to have a new corpse to examine, sometimes allowing them to rot in his chambers anywhere from days to months, steadfast to scrutinise the stages of decomposition. He dug up the corpse of his aunt, Alavara, in order to perform experiments on her.</p>
            <p>　　»» Over the years, his experimentations took over the majority of his life, mingling passion with obsession. He learned to manipulate into life many mutations, some failed, some successful.</p>
