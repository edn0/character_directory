                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Nyssa Matthews (Formerly known as Katlynn Maddox).</p>
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-six years old (Fake birthdate: October 25th, 1995 - Scorpio).</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Doppelgänger / Witch from the Chevalier bloodline with unlocked powers.</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p>
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Secretary / Aspiring ballerina.</p>
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Available.</p>
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p>
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Katlynn was, for as far as she could remember, tormented. This torment led to a desperate need to explode, lash out - thus that's what she did, and eventually, became. Despite good intentions, she is twisted and deranged. Though she is capable of love and affection, you'd be a fool to trust a woman like her. In this new version of her, she has become somewhat of a gold-digger as she misses the wealth she once had.</p>
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Phoebe Tonkin.</p>
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p> 
                <p>　　 Same background story as Katlynn, as she is the same character.</p>
                <p>　　 Katlynn was sentenced to life imprisonment on April 10th, 2019 for her numerous crimes, as well as her confession.</p>
                <p>　　  On October 12th, 2019, she was knocked out and forced out of her cell by Damon Roux. She was dropped out of nowhere with a note, saying she couldn't quit the game so easily. Thus, she found Kalisia and explained everything. The latter solely agreed to help her, if she helped her catch Damon in return. Therefore, Katlynn agreed.</p>
                <p>　　 She was hidden away in witness protection for over a year whilst working with the police, telling them everything she knew about him and his methods. How they had met, everything he had ever told her, where he had ever brought her. All of it. This gave her a new purpose, despite the isolation that came with being in witness protection. Moreover, it granted her a very much needed break from the rest of the world and its atrocities.</p>
                <p>　　 Eventually, however, she was sent back into the world under another identity since hers had been entirely erased from all known records. In addition to that, even if her name was erased from society, some people remembered. Be it her name or her face, some of them remembered the infamous Katlynn Maddox as the woman who tortured and murdered hundreds of men and women. Thus, she had to change. And change, she did as she became Nyssa Matthews.</p>
                <p>　　  As Nyssa, she dyed her hair and wore lenses. She was given a backstory, as well as a job and an apartment to get her going. From the wealthy woman who used to only need snap her fingers to get what she desired, she became a mere civilian. With her identity erased, so was her wealth and as much as she misses it, there is no way of getting it back now.</p>
                 
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
