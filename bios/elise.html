                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Elise Woods.</p> 
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Appears to be in her late twenties.</p>  
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Regenerated human.</p>  
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p>  
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. She/Her.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Freelance painter.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Available (multi-ship).</p>  
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic good : those that combine a good heart with a free spirit.</p>  
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Elise has been many things throughout her numerous regenerations, but she has always been kind. Sometimes, in a more obvious fashion than others, but her heart has always remained a gentle one, albeit battered and bruised on many occasions. She seeks to do good, for better or for worse. A little naive at times, or perhaps quite talented in the arts of lying. But something cannot be a lie, unless it is discovered as one. Until then, don’t believe everything you see.</p> 
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Jenna Coleman.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>  
                <p>　　 Raised in a family of ancient warlocks, Elise, at the time called Sutton, always felt out of place : as if a part of her knew she never belonged. Perhaps was it the pained looks she often received, whether it be from her father or her mother, or the lack of her own magical abilities. Yet, she was flesh and bone as they were, and she shared physical traits with both. Thus, she never questioned it. Until she reached the age of curiosity, and explored the manor she had never truly been able to call home. A somber place indeed, but it was the only place she’d ever known.</p>  
                <p>　　 Sheltered for the better part of her youth, Sutton one day managed to slip out and feel the cold air on her skin. Wind, as she understood it. It was then she went beyond what the window in her chambers permitted her to see, beyond the large tree that covered everything. Quite literally. On the other side of the tree, she found a grave with her name on it. Sutton Taylor, gone too soon. There was a picture, too. It was her, or perhaps it was who she was meant to be. When her parents found her there, they wept. Perhaps more than she’d ever heard them, let alone seen them do despite the very sound having haunted most of her childhood’s nights. It was then the truth came out : Sutton was none other than a replica of the daughter they had lost to illness.</p>  
                <p>　　 Something broke inside of her when finding out who she was, or rather, who she was not. Sutton ran, never to be seen again. At least, not to the beasts who’d created her only to leave her to rot in a fancy manor for they could not bare the sight of what they’d done. As much as they wished to love her, they never managed to. For she wasn’t their girl, she was an attempt to mourn. A failed one. But one’s failure could be another’s victory. And thus, Sutton died as she was always meant to : and the person who rose again, was Elise Woods. For years, she learned to live as any normal person would, creating herself on her own. But while others aged, she never did. Something inside of her blocked it, and while she may have viewed it as a gift, once upon a time, she has learned to consider it a damning curse.</p>  
                <p>　　 Therefore, she made the decision to install a rule she only would follow, for her own sanity. Every fifty years, Elise would regenerate herself. She would forget about the years spent, and begin anew to a time when her immortality was bearable. And every fifty years, she would be sent a reminder to apply the rule, granting her brief memories of past lives she’d forgotten before being erased again.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
