                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Nova Rosalia Valentine-Sinclair.</p> 
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Written as a flash-forward character.</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Witch with part of Lucifer's powers, added to her own heritage as an arcane witch like her mother and grandfather.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. She/Her.</p>
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Studies art and dance.</p>
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Unattached (multi-ship).</p> 
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic good : those that combine a good heart with a free spirit.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Nova has a relatively fiery temper : mostly due to how her powers more often rule her than she rules them. She cares deeply about her family, as any Valentine before her, and would do just about anything to secure their safety. Even if it meant sacrificing her own life, or someone else's. She is very attached to art, and she mostly expresses what she cannot bring herself to say through dance. Nova has, like her mother, a definite attraction to darkness : which is only fueled by the dark aspect of her powers. That expends to her taste in men and women.</p>
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Sydney Sweeney.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p> 
                <p>　　 Nova, like her twin, was the result of an unexpected pregnancy. As a result, when they were born, their parents had already long ago broken up for a reason the girls still aren't aware of. Though Beau and Violet eventually returned together when they reached their early teenage years, most of their childhood was spent going from one home to another. In spite of that, it remained a happy one as their parents knew to set their differences aside to care for their daughters. They were taught to love, and be kind to others : all of which neither of their parent had been taught themselves.</p> 
                <p>　　 The two girls were always meant to be powerful given their heritage : a mental warlock for a father, and an arcane witch for a mother. However, it all changed when, one night, Violet decided to take her revenge on Lucifer and kill them for having taken their uncle's soul. But as she plunged a dagger into their heart, and chanted the spell she had thoroughly taught herself : Lucifer's powers were siphoned. From the depth of the Devil's chest, straight to Violet's womb. Her sister inherited the light, and she inherited the darkness.</p>
                <p>　　 Their sole existence represent the defiance that was done by their family, to the Devil themselves. As a result, the girls will be haunted. Not only by Lucifer's lingering loyalists, but also by daemons who wished to cease the power of the former Lord for themselves.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
