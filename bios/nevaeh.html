                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Nevaeh Thompson.</p> 
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-six years old.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Sensate.</p>  
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p>  
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. She/Her.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Escort / Professional thief and criminal.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Unavailable.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p> 
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Nevaeh has commitment issues, and strong issues that all root from her parents. She struggles to be real with people, as she has been taught to be the opposite her entire life. Nevaeh is a liar, pure and simple. Or it would be, were it not for her deep desire to be seen for what she truly is : which is everything she refuses to admit she is.</p>  
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Cindy Kimberly / Emeraude Toubia.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>  
                <p>　　 Born among criminals, Nevaeh was expected to be just as devious. And without fail, she became a thief. The first time she was arrested by the police, Nevaeh was fifteen: her parents had left her on the scene the second police had arrived, leaving her to be taken into custody. She, however, refused to say anything and since she was a minor, she was only sent to juvie: she spent two months there before her parents gathered the money to bail her out.</p> 
                <p>　　 Not long after was Nevaeh forced into sex-work by her own parents, she'd been forced to lie about her age since, at the time, she was still very much a minor despite her claims. Thus, on the side of occasional robberies, Nevaeh would work as an escort to all types of clients.</p> 
                <p>　　 While she'd never denied her parents anything, she'd tried to deny them this: which was, coincidentally, also the first time she'd been victim to their violence. Ever since, she has not dared oppose them, though she does train on the daily to be ready to fight back if they ever do try and lay a hand on her.</p> 
                <p>　　 Though it is sad to say, Nevaeh has abandoned all dreams for a better life than the one she has, having grown numb and aggressive throughout the years: though never to potential clients, at least not when she's in the bar.</p> 
                <p>　　 Despite it all, she does have affection for her boss and cares a great deal for her, in fact, she would go as far as to say she is more of a parent despite how close they are in age.</p> 
                <p>　　 She discovers during an assault that she is part of a cluster, people she is supernaturally connected with: she can see and touch them, despite being miles away from each other. They feel what others feel: they are one.</p>
