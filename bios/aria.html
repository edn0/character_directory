                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Aria Jensen.</p>  
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-six years old.</p>  
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Human.</p> 
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p>  
                <p>𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐬. She/Her.</p> 
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Defense attorney.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Unavailable (single-ship).</p>  
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. 𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p>  
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Aria, in spite of her profession, has never been too fond of rules. It reminded her of her past, of limits she never wanted to impose to herself again, of people getting hurt : herself included. She does what she does, because she's good at it. As simple as that. Still, she maintains a certain disdain for the law, for what is deemed to be justice by the government. She doesn't necessarily disclose that part of her to anyone, keeping certain aspects of herself hidden away. Aria is two sides of the coin, all rolled into one lethal woman. She is as charismatic as she can be cold, as distant as she can be persuasive. A mystery to most : sometimes, even to her own mother.</p>  
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Krysten Ritter.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>  
                <p>     Aria was raised in a violent and unforgiving household, though it all could be resumed with one name : Archer Jensen. Her father. He was ruthless and cruel, never once considering the dire effect his actions may have on others. Indeed, he once beat up her mother so badly she had to be sent to the ER : there were questions asked, but Archer was an intelligent man. He played the part, and her mother was too frightened of the consequences to ever dare deny his version of event. She was a good enough actress, a skill she later on passed to her daughter. Aria had learned to keep to herself, and make herself scarce : agreeing to whatever her father said, no matter the topic. And there were quite a few things he seemed interested in when it came to his daughter, sometimes more so than he was with his own wife.</p>  
                <p>     One night, as he went into her bedroom to pursue the horrors he had done for years, her mother stepped into the room with a gun : threatening to kill him if he didn't let go of Aria. This was the first time she truly saw her mother, beyond the act, beyond the bruises and the tears. It was the first time she saw her strength. It was beautiful. Archer merely laughed at her, approached her until the end of the gun was pressed against his chest : Sophie, her mother, did nothing. All she did was stare, trembling. In a heartbeat, he was on her, beating her to the ground after shoving the gun aside. He liked to feel the blood on his hands, he'd once told her after a drunken night, a threat. As Aria watched a scene she'd seen too many times already despite her young age, her eyes caught a glimpse of the gun on the floor. Discreetly, she creeped behind him and then - shot him in the head. Once, twice, thrice. She only stopped when she fear the hole in his head was wide enough to see through. At least, that's what her young brain remembers it as.</p>  
                <p>     The gunshots alarmed the neighbors, who called the police. One man who had noticed her mother's past bruises even came rushing to the door, kicking it opened. Aria liked him, because he was kind to Sophie. He brought her flowers, which she would throw to the trash in fear her husband found them. But she knew she liked them, liked the sort of kind gesture she had not known in years. When he stepped in, however, the first thing he saw was the gun in Aria's small hands, his mother bloodied and bruised on the floor, Archer's corpse atop of her. He understood, she could tell from the way his eyes went back to her, fixated there for an instant. She didn't understand it at the time when he took the gun and wiped her fingerprints off of it, putting his own all over it instead. But she remembered the cops handcuffing him, a final glance thrown in Sophie's direction.</p>  
                <p>     Only years later did she comprehend it, what he'd done for her, for them. He'd given up on his entire life, merely to protect them. She didn't know the depth of his relationship with her mother then, but there is one thing she does know : her mother never found another lover, and religiously visited the prison to see him every week.</p> 
                <p>     Aria grew older, and bitter. All the rage her father had put inside of her resurfaced, as well as the trauma that came with the realization that she'd been sexually abused by her own father as a child. It caused her to have a certain aversion to touch, which she'll only ever indulged if forced to or comfortable enough with the person : though that has yet to happen. The sole person she allows to hold her being her mother, and no one else. In her teens, Aria began taking lessons to defend herself : becoming quite proficient at it, even if it began as a mere outlet to let out all of that rage she'd kept buried deep within.</p>  
                
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐦. Adaptable.</p>
