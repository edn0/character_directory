                <p>𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞. Katlynn Maddox (née Léna Chevalier).</p>
                <p>𝐚𝐠𝐞. Twenty-six years old (January 25th, 1990 - Aquarius).</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬. Doppelgänger / Witch from the Chevalier bloodline with unlocked powers.</p>
                <p>𝐬𝐞𝐱𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Bisexual.</p>
                
                <p>𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Model / Serial killer.</p>
                
                <p>𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩. Available.</p>
                
                <p>𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭. Chaotic neutral : those that represent true, unhindered freedom, often eliminating harmony, shirking societal precepts, and order.</p>
                <p>𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Katlynn was, for as far as she could remember, tormented. This torment led to a desperate need to explode, lash out - thus that's what she did, and eventually, became. Despite good intentions, she is twisted and deranged. Though she is capable of love and affection, you'd be a fool to trust a woman like her.</p>
                <p>𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞-𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦. Carlson Young / Erin Moriarty / Jodie Comer.</p>
                
                <p>𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬.</p>
                <p>　　 Born from a broken family, Léna and her twin brother Lucas were abandoned in an orphanage in Paris. While her brother was taken by a family in mere weeks, Léna didn't get so lucky. Indeed, she stayed there until she reached fifteen years old. During that time, she met a boy named Kieran. He had been abandoned around the same time as her, thus they grew up together. Friendship turned to love, and when time came to be adopted, she would sometimes act out just so that she could stay with him. Alas, he didn't return the favor. Therefore, when the Maddox family took interest in her, she behaved and was finally adopted as well.</p>
                <p>　　 Léna Chevalier became Katlynn Maddox, and she moved with her foster parents to their home in Russia. Considering she didn't speak a word of it, she was homeschooled in English, as she already had notions of it, with classes on the side so she would learn to speak the language as if she were a native. As brilliant as she was, it didn't cause any problem, though she remained homeschooled even once fluent in Russian and English.</p>
                <p>　　 Entering the Maddox family didn't only grant her wealth and education, however. It would have been too easy. The Maddox household came with Thomas Maddox - her foster mother's brother. After having been abusive to Anastasia, her foster mother, for years, Katlynn's arrival spiked his interest. Thus began the nightmare she would be stuck into for three years : he would come to her room at night and sexually abuse her, each night her foster father Viktor was away was one he would spend between her legs.</p>
                <p>　　 Eventually, came her eighteenth birthday - and for this special event, Katlynn decided to end her nightmare as it appeared no one else was willing to help her. Not Anastasia, not the cops, no one. Therefore, she poisoned him thanks to a drug she'd gotten from a friend. He died a long and painful death.</p>
                <p>　　 Not long after, she was sent to a mental facility to help her recover from suicidal thoughts and anorexia. She stayed there for a year before feigning wellness and getting herself out.</p>
                <p>　　 Having done modeling in her youth, Katlynn picked up right where she'd left off and began a more professional career alongside her passion of becoming a ballerina. Which she succeeded in accomplishing, as every other thing she'd ever wanted to do. She was, indeed, quite ambitious : but most of all, she craved the distractions from the thoughts inside her head that begged for the rush she'd felt when murdering her foster uncle.</p>
                <p>　　 A couple years after getting out of the mental facility, she met Kieran again. This time, however, she refused to let him go. They got together despite her having been in a relationship at the time, and soon got engaged. Alas, one night, a man Kieran had failed to put behind bars came for him and murdered him in their own home. He spared her, as she hadn't been his target : but what he didn't know was that by doing this, he'd created a monster.</p>
                <p>　　 From this point, Katlynn's life went downhill. She lost herself in her obsessions, giving into the voices inside her head. At last, she spilled the blood she'd been desperate to since her first kill. She became a mindless beast, killing whoever bothered her in the slightest : until she was given a purpose. She would kill rapists, as they were the ones to blame for her bloodlust to begin with.</p>
                <p>　　 Exactly a year after Kieran's death, Katlynn committed the first crime she wanted people to hear about. It was then she introduced herself as “L'éxécutrice”.</p>
                <p>　　 For years, she perdured. Until, one night, she was abused by one of the men she aimed to kill - that drove her off the edge and she became mindless again for a short while. In a brief instant of clarity, she decided to turn herself in because without a purpose, she wasn't the woman she wanted to be. And, it was about time to expose her truth. Thus, in 2019, she turned herself in to detective Kalisia Tenelth. She was judged, heard and sentenced to life in prison. Everything had gone according to plan, aside from one thing : she planned to die in prison by her own hand. Alas, her nemesis had decided otherwise and broke her out.</p>
